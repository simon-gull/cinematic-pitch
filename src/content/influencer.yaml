  name: "Simon Gullström"
  text: "Early in my career, I made content for influencers and their agencies. I was fascinated by the world from an anthropological perspective. The psychology behind the facade, the subtle dynamics, their growing role in society. I want to translate that fascination into a cinematic experience that dives deep into the influencer culture of the past decade. The tone is crucial. Subtle, elevated, and at times absurd — but the visual language stays calm, intellectual, and artistic. More Tár than parody."
